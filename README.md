## Spring webflux JWT example
-

this is spring webflux jwt token example. 

I was inspired by the git hub project below.

`
https://github.com/raphaelDL/spring-webflux-security-jwt
`

I referenced the project above to make a JWT token custom filter, and added an example of extracting tokens from Route.
